# Emulator

This Folder houses the IN DEVELOPMENT emulator of the CPU, as a reference,
And also be used to verify instructions run correctly on the real hardware after the emulator has been finalized and validated.

# Dev

This emulator is being coded in rust, and will simply be a loose implementation of the architecture and ISA,
Final CPU will be a FPGA based system, emulator will be used to verify ***SOME*** programs however not all.

The work has not yet began on the emulator, and for the time being, 
due to internal reasons, 
development on any Asterisk related projects will be slow except maybe on Saturdays till June.

***NOTE***: The emulator is/will only be updated every ***MAJOR*** iteration of the actual architecture implementation,
as such, the emulator should only be used for as a simple playground.
